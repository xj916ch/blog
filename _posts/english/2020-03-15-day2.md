What`s up?

Alex is helping Abby with the recycling program.

**What do you need help with?**  -->need help with something

**Abby needs some help with making signs.**

What does the sign say?

~~口语用法：You can go ask her. They`ll come help us.~~

Can you think of other things that we can do to take care of our world?

Good work!

But she must be doing a good job.

How`s it going?

What is it that you need help with?

Anything with this symbol can be recycled.

Because recycling will lead to less garbage.

It takes twice as much energy to burn plastic than it does to recycle it.

So we hope that you come back for a new show tomorrow here.
